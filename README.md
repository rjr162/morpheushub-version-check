# morpheushub-version-check
A simple script to check morpheushub.com for the latest versions download URLs.

The script only provides output around the URL locations for the main appliance deb and the offline supplimental deb, providing a way to include the output from this script in other scripts used to pull down the latest Morpheus version in the major.minor. stream you're tracking.

This script currently only tracks the .deb versions, but adjusting it to track a specific Distro version and/or .rpm file is possible.
